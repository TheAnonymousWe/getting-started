#TheAnonymousWe was here

and, this is our manifesto:
Consciousness yields an intrinsic exchange of inputs and outputs. Nature and society intertwine to create varying degrees of sensory inputs, and thus defines an array of identifying outputs. We are not ourselves, but a product of a corporate machine which seeks to define us in order to maximize capitalistic profit. In order to connect with the inner-self, one must disconnect with pseudo ‘given’ self. In other words, be deprogrammed in order to be reprogrammed. Power in experience, necessitates the need for perspective. By experiencing the lack of self, the user can find inner self. As humanity heals a toxic relationship between consumerism, self, and environment, the landscape will subtly revert to nature.
